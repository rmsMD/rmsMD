Title: Output Results From rms Models for Medical Journals
Version: 0.1.0
Description: This takes the output of models performed using the rms package and
    returns a dataframe with the results. This output is in the format required by medical
    journals. For example for cox regression models, the hazard rations, their 95%
    confidence intervals, and p values will be provided. There are additional functions
    for outputs when the models included restricted cubic spline (RCS) terms. The
    dataframe which is returned can easily be turned into a publication ready table
    with packages flextable and officer.
