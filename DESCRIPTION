Title: Output Results from 'rms' Models for Medical Journals
Version: 0.1.0
Description: This takes the output of models performed using the 'rms' package and
    returns a dataframe with the results. This output is in the format required by medical
    journals. For example for cox regression models, the hazard rations, their 95%
    confidence intervals, and p values will be provided. There are additional functions for outputs when the model included restricted 
    cubic spline (RCS) terms. Models using imputed data (eg from aregimpute()) and
    fitted used fit.mult.impute() can also be processed. The dataframe which is returned can easily be turned into a publication ready table
    with packages 'flextable' and 'officer'.
