Title: Output Results from 'rms' Models for Medical Journals
Version: 1.0.0
Date: 2025-03-03
Description: This package provides streamlined functions for summarising and visualising 
  regression models fitted with the 'rms' package, in the preferred format for medical journals. 
  The `modelsummary_rms` function produces concise summaries for linear, logistic, and 
  Cox regression models, including automatic handling of models containing restricted 
  cubic spline (RCS) terms. The resulting summary dataframe can be easily converted into 
  publication-ready documents using the 'flextable' and 'officer' packages. The `ggrmsMD` 
  function creates clear and customizable plots (ggplot2) to visualise RCS terms.
